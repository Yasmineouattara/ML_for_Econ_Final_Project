The main submission paper for the project is [here](https://github.com/Yasmineouattara/ML_for_Econ_Final_Project/blob/main/ML_for_Econ_Final_Paper.pdf). 

The results are housed in two main files:
* For Method I: Causal Forest, HTEs estimated are [here](https://github.com/Yasmineouattara/ML_for_Econ_Final_Project/blob/main/CausalForest2.ipynb)
* For Method II: DML, ATE and SE estimates are [here](https://github.com/Yasmineouattara/ML_for_Econ_Final_Project/blob/main/Data12m_NA_experiment_cleaned.ipynb), full tables [here](https://github.com/Yasmineouattara/ML_for_Econ_Final_Project/blob/main/Updated%20Tables.pdf)


The data is consolidated in the `OHIE_Data` folder. The imputed data for DML is also in this file. 

Other files are for data exploration, and other supplementary analyses.
